# ESPNode
For ESP8266 / NodeMCU hardware

Can be [herded](https://github.com/leibert/ESPHerder)

Multi-purpose light/logic controller. Has dimming, RGB, and binary control and simple input handling. 

A simple html file is sent via the http connection with a script tag referencing a remote location that can be easily updated if needed.
Once the UI script [(link)](https://github.com/leibert/ESPNode/tree/master/ESPNodeUI) is loaded, it will request the configuration from the ESP and subsequently load the needed channel control elements (switch/color dimming/etc)
